These resources are collectively utilized to perform various tasks, store data, and run applications. Resource providers can be devices (such as computers or servers) connected to the network from individuals or organizations.\nQuasarplane operates on the principle of distributed computing, where resources are sourced from multiple nodes (computers or servers) spread across the network. Unlike traditional centralized cloud services, where resources are provided by a single or a few data centers owned by a specific company, Quasarplane distributes the workload across a vast network of independent participants.\nResource providers in Quasarplane play a crucial role in ensuring the availability, reliability, and scalability of the platform. Users looking to host applications, store data, or execute tasks can leverage the resources provided by these entities.\nTiers Providers that are onboarded into Quasarplane belong to one of two tiers. Each tier is a direct measure of the quality of the services a Provider offers.\nTier 1 - These providers are audited by external auditors and Quasarch has made due diligence on it. Tier 2 - Providers that have completed the Tier 1 and are direct partners of Quasarch. Tiers serve as incentives for Providers to better their services and begin a partnership relation with Quasarch. The more high tier Providers in the platform, the better service Quasarplane can provide which creates a collaborative integration between both entities.\nTypes of Providers Quasarplane, and by extension the Quasarch Cloud Platform as a whole, support several types of Resource Providers. They form the infrastructure layer that will support the cloud services offered by the platform.\nCompute Providers Compute Providers in Quasarplane are entities that offer computational resources, such as processing power, memory and storage to the platform. These resources are used to perform a wide range of tasks, including running applications and processing data. Compute providers are a fundamental component of Quasarplane and contribute to the overall computing power and capacity of the platform.\nHere are a few key points about Compute Providers in Quasarplane:\nDecentralized Nature - Compute Providers in a Decentralized Cloud Platform such as Quasarplane operate on a peer-to-peer network, where resources are sourced from individual computers or servers connected to the network. This ensures that the computing power is distributed across several entities rather than being concentrated in a few centralized data centers. Resource Sharing - Compute Providers share their computational resources, such as CPU cycles, RAM and GPUs, with the network. These resources will be utilized by developers, businesses, or other users to run applications and perform various computing tasks through Quasarplane’s Cloud Services. Incentives - Compute Providers are typically incentivized for their contributions to the network. These incentives encourage more individuals and organizations to participate, leading to a larger and more powerful Quasarplane. Security and Trust - Quasarplane employs encryption and cryptographic techniques to ensure the security and privacy of computations and data processing performed by Compute Providers. This is essential to maintain the integrity of applications and trust in the platform. In summary, Compute Providers in Quasarplane contribute their computational resources to the network, enabling a distributed, secure, and efficient computing infrastructure for various Quasarplane cloud services.
