Quasarch's Container Service is a decentralized, highly scalable, container management service that makes it easy to run and manage your containers on a serverless infrastructure.
This infrastructure is managed by Quasarch which launches your services and workloads on a Decentralized Compute Marketplace.

By using a decentralized protocol to lease resources from a global network of compute providers, we can offer our users a lower cost, censorship-resistant, localized hosting solution to run containers.
Container Service also supports a range of Nvidia GPUs to be used by containers.

## Why decentralized?

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, also known as DePINs, are open and accessible networks, in contrast with traditional infrastructure that often end up with a centralized entity that dictates the terms and conditions for what users can do with the services provided.
This can have a direct negative impact on innovation, cost and user-experience.

Globally decentralized networks allow projects to be deployed on regions closer to where the business operates, bringing products closer to its users.
