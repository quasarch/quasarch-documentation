Security is a shared responsibility between Quasarch, its providers and you.
* **Quasarch** - Quasarch's responsibility is to securely distribute workloads across the different providers and taking measures in securing your data. Providers do not get information on who is hosting a particular container from Quasarch.
* **Providers** - Providers are responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs Quasarch services in the Quasarch Cloud. [Third-party auditors]() as well as Quasarch regularly test and verify the effectiveness of their security and compliance.
* **You** - Your responsibility is determined by the Quasarch Console service that you use. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your companyâ€™s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.

Full system security is only achieved if these 3 entities ensure a secure and compliant collaboration and data handling between each other.
