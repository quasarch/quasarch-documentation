Quasarplane is a control plane for decentralized cloud services.
It serves as layer to manage and guarantee enterprise-grade properties to decentralized systems.

Quasarplane is the backbone of [Quasarch Console](), providing most of the functionality available on it.
It is important to understand how both of these components work together to make the most out of the platform or build your own integrations with Quasarplane.

## Integrating

Quasarplane was designed with integration enabled from the ground up.
Integration can be done either through our managed service or a self-hosted solution.
**For a self-hosted solution integration contact the team.**

The API can be accessed through REST. For more information read the [API reference](api-reference).
