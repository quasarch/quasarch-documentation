Quasarplane is a control plane for decentralized cloud services and DePINs.
It serves as layer to manage and guarantee enterprise-grade properties to decentralized systems.

Quasarplane is the backbone of [Quasarch Console]() and what makes Quasarch Cloud Platform run, providing most of the functionality available on it.
It is important to understand how both of these components work together to make the most out of the platform or build your own integrations with Quasarch Cloud Platform.

The following documentation will provide you with everything you need to understand how the platform works and how you can build your own solutions on top of it.
This documentation will not guide you through the usage of the Console, for that visit the [Console documentation](../Tutorials/containers)

## Integrating

Quasarplane was designed with integration as an architectural characteristic since the beginning.
Integration can be done either through our managed service or a self-hosted solution.
**For a self-hosted solution integration contact the team.**

The API can be accessed through REST. For more information read the [API reference](api-reference).
